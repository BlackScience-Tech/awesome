## Input/Output
- [GDAL](https://gdal.org): You know who
- [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/): Reads and writes geospatial raster data.

## Satellite Specific
- [Landsat-Util](https://pythonhosted.org/landsat-util/): A command line utility that makes it easy to search, download, and process Landsat imagery.
- [SentinelHub](http://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/): Allows users to make OGC (WMS and WCS) web requests to download and process satellite images within your Python scripts. It supports Sentinel-2 L1C and L2A, Sentinel-1, Landsat 8, MODIS and DEM data source.

## Atmospheric Correction
- [MULTIPLY - Sensor Invariant Atmospheric Correction (SIAC)](https://siac.readthedocs.io/): This atmospheric correction method uses MODIS MCD43 BRDF product to get a coarse resolution simulation of earth surface.
- [Atmospheric and Radiometric Correction of Satellite Imagery (ARCSI)](https://www.arcsi.remotesensing.info/): Provide as automatic as possible method of generating Analysis Ready Data (ARD).

## Processing
- [EarthPy](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/)

## Crop Simulation
- [Python Crop Simulation Environment - PCSE](https://pcse.readthedocs.io/): A framework developed for implementing crop simulation models developed in Wageningen.
